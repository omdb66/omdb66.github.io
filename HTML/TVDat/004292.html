<p>Die englische Comedytruppe Monty Python, bestehend aus Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones und Michael Palin, blödelte sich durch diese absurde Sketchshow, in der ein Gag an den anderen gereiht war. Inhaltlich war alles möglich, je unmöglicher eine Situation erschien, desto komischer wurde sie. Albernes Slapstick, kalauernde Wortspiele und feinsinnige Satire wurden geschickt vermischt. Als Thema für die Sketche konnte alles herhalten, z. B. Bürokratie oder Historie, auch das Fernsehen wurde regelmäßig parodiert. In manchen Folgen war Carol Cleveland als zusätzliche Darstellerin dabei. Unterbrochen wurden die Sketche oft nur von Cleeses Ansage "Und nun zu etwas völlig anderem" oder von kurzen animierten surrealistischen Einspielern, in denen beispielsweise Monster, Blumen oder Köpfe Monster, Blumen oder Köpfe fraßen, Menschen sich zerteilten, von riesigen Füßen plattgetreten wurden etc. Terry Gilliam war für diese Animationen verantwortlich. Die Titelmusik war der "Liberty Bell March" von John Philip Sousa. Einer der bekanntesten Sketche der Reihe wurde der "Parrot Sketch", in dem ein Kunde (Cleese) sich beim Verkäufer in einer Tierhandlung (Palin) darüber beklagt, dass der von ihm gekaufte Papagei tot sei. Während beide mit dem durchaus toten Tier hantieren, versucht Palin Cleese davon zu überzeugen, dass der Papagei nur ein Nickerchen mache.Der BBC-Redakteur Barry Took hatte die Truppe für die Sendung zusammengebracht und damit den Grundstein für einen gigantischen Erfolg und eine der einflussreichsten Shows der Comedygeschichte gelegt. In den letzten sechs Folgen der Serie, die jetzt im Original nur noch "Monty Python" hieß, ist John Cleese nicht mehr dabei. Nach der TV-Serie wurden diverse Monty-Python-Kinofilme gedreht, vor allem "Die Ritter der Kokosnuss" ("Monty Python And The Holy Grail"; 1974) und "Das Leben des Brian" ("Monty Python's Life Of Brian"; 1979) wurden Klassiker. Zusätzlich zu den 45 Folgen der BBC entstanden 1971 und 1972 unter dem Titel Monty Python's fliegender Zirkus zwei Folgen in Deutschland, Erstere sogar in deutscher Sprache.Die ARD zeigte 1971 und 1972 eine Hand voll Folgen im Ersten und in den Dritten Programmen im Original mit deutschen Untertiteln. Komplett war die Reihe in Deutschland erst ab 1991 in N3 zu sehen - ebenfalls im Originalton. Sat.1 wagte sich 1998 erstmals an die Synchronisation des schwierig zu übersetzenden britischen Humors und zeigte alle 45 Folgen im Spätprogramm. Zur Überraschung von Fans und Kritikern war die Serie auch in der deutschen Fassung nach wie vor witzig.</p>

<h1>Specials</h1>
<h1>Episode01: And Now for Something Completely Different</h1>
<p>A collection of re-filmed sketches from the first and second series of the cult TV comedy show "Monty Python's Flying Circus". Includes such classics as "Nudge, Nudge", "Hell's Grannies", "Killer Cars", "Dead Parrot", "Lumberjack Song", "Blackmail" and "Upper Class Twit of the Year</p>
<h1>Episode02: Holy Grail</h1>
<p>The movie starts out with Arthur, King of the Britons, looking for knights to sit with him at Camelot. He finds many knights including Sir Galahad the pure, Sir Lancelot the brave, the quiet Sir Bedevere, and Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir Lancelot. They do not travel on horses, but pretend they do and have their servants bang coconuts to make the sound of horse's hooves. Through satire of certain events in history (witch trials, the black plague) they find Camelot, but after literally a quick song and dance they decide that they do not want to go there. While walking away, God (who seems to be grumpy) come to them from a cloud and tells them to find the Holy Grail. They agree and begin their search. While they search for the Grail, scenes of the knight's tales appear and why they have the name they have. Throughout their search they meet interesting people and knights along the way. Most of the characters die; some through a killer rabbit (which they defeat with the holy hand grenade), others from not answering a question right from the bridge of Death, or die some other ridiculous way. In the end, King Arthur and Sir Bedevere are left and find the Castle Arrrghhh where the Holy Grail is. They are met by some French soldiers who taunted them earlier in the film, so they were not able to get into the castle</p>
<h1>Episode03: Jabberwocky</h1>
<p>After the death of his father the young cooper 'Dennis Cooper' goes to town where he has to pass several adventures. The town and the whole kingdom is threatened by a terrible monster called 'Jabberwocky'. Will Dennis make his fortune? Is anyone brave enough to defeat the monster? A medieval tale with Pythonesque humour.</p>
<h1>Episode04: Life of Brian</h1>
<p>Brian is born in a stable on Christmas, right next to You Know Who. The wise men appear and begin to distribute gifts. The star moves further, so they take it all back and move on. This is how Brian's life goes. The Jews are looking for a release from the Romans, Spiritual and political decay, keep looking for signs and a group decides Brian is the Messiah. He cannot convince them he is not. He joins the Peoples' Front of Judea, one of several dozen separatist groups who actually do nothing, but really hate the Romans. While not about Jesus, it is about those who hadn't time, or interest to listen to his message. Many Political and Social comments.  Written by John Vogel {jlvogel@comcast.net}The Monty Pyton team tells the life, death and resurrection (?) of Brian from Nazareth, an unwilling prophet who wants to free his land from the oppression of Rome. When Brian covers a huge wall with the writing "ROMANI ITE DOMUM" (Romans go home), a local revolutionary group begins to take him seriously...</p>
<h1>Episode05: Live at the Hollywood Bowl</h1>
<p>A collection of skits that made the Python troup famous, performed live at the Hollywood Bowl. Included are the singing philosophers, lumberjacks, the pope, and a suspiciously-male looking seabird vendor. </p>
<h1>Episode06: The Meaning of Life</h1>
<p>The comedy groups last full length movie returns to the feel of the hugely popular BBC TV show. It features small comedy sketches dealing with all of the stages and trials of life. Expect the un-expected. Plenty of religious, vulgar, and sexual humor may offend some groups. There are even musical numbers, but with that same unmistakable brand of Python humor. The Monty Python group examines the meaning and purpose of life in a series of sketches from conception to death and beyond. In typical Monty Python fashion they satirizes and humourizes almost everyone</p>
<h1>Episode07: Blödeln für Deutschland</h1>
<p>The Pythons had planned to rearrange sketches from the two German specials into a sketch film had Life of Brian not been filmed. With Brian completed, these German shows were not introduced in America in their entirety until the Python retrospective 17 and 24 February 1989. The Museum of Television and Radio in New York introduced these unseen hours in part to celebrate the Pythons' 20th anniversary and, hopefully, to release the specials to a TV network or to video. The second special for WDR was the Pythons' rebuttal of a BBC proposal to send a compilation show to Germany. This program was filmed with one less burden: the cast could speak in English.Connie Booth had begun writing with John Cleese by this time, and the two turned out the "Fairy Tale" sketch, later reprinted in The Brand New Monty Python Bok. Other sketches are summarized in Kim "Howard" Johnson's book The First 280 Years of Monty Python, published by St. Martin's Press.</p>
<h1>Episode08: Blödeln auf die feine englische Art</h1>
<p>The Pythons had planned to rearrange sketches from the two German specials into a sketch film had Life of Brian not been filmed. With Brian completed, these German shows were not introduced in America in their entirety until the Python retrospective 17 and 24 February 1989.

<h1>Episode09: Parrot Sketch Not Included</h1>
<p>Parrot Sketch Not Included - 20 Years of Monty Python was a tribute special to the Monty Python comedy group.

The Dead Parrot sketch was not included.</p>
<h1>Episode10: Live at Aspen</h1>
<p>"Live at Aspen" reunites the five remaining Pythons (the sixth one, Graham Chapman, also "appears" in the form of his ashes - a gimmick that is both macabre and moving) on stage for the first time in about 16 years. But although it's included in the same DVD ("Monty Python Live!") with "Live at the Hollywood Bowl", it's not really a live show. It's more of a documentary / tribute. </p>
<h1>Episode11: Python Night</h1>
<p>Python Night - 30 Years of Python was a special run of Monty Python related programs broadcast on BBC2 on October 5, 1999, the 30th Anniversary of the first broadcast of Monty Python's Flying Circus.</p>

<h1>Episode13: Monty Python In Aberystwyth</h1>
<p>In 1979, Monty Python's Life of Brian opened in cinemas around Britain, finding a place for itself in movie history. However, the film's release was plagued by controversy, causing many local authorities to ban showings of the feature. By 2009, the ban only remains in place in Aberystwyth. This documentary reveals how Sue Jones-Davies, the city's mayor — and the actor who played Brian's girlfriend in the movie — has campaigned to have the ban lifted. Includes contributions by Pythons Michael Palin and Terry Jones</p>
<h1>Episode14: Birds Eye Industrial Film</h1>
<p>A short film by Monty Python made in the early 1970s, never intended to be seen by the public, only for the employees of Birds Eye.Although these industrial films are largely aimed at the staff of said companies, the information they provide is injected by a large dose of typically Python humor and is essential viewing for the Python completeness.</p>
<h1>Episode15: Harmony Hairspray Industrial Film</h1>
<p>A short film by Monty Python made in the early 1970s, never intended to be seen by the public, only for the employees of Harmony Hairspray.Although these industrial films are largely aimed at the staff of said companies, the information they provide is injected by a large dose of typically Python humor and is essential viewing for the Python completeness.</p>
<h1>Episode16: Close Up Toothpaste Industrial Film</h1>
<p>A short film by Monty Python made in the early 1970s, never intended to be seen by the public, only for the employees of Close Up toothpaste.Although these industrial films are largely aimed at the staff of said companies, the information they provide is injected by a large dose of typically Python humor and is essential viewing for the Python completeness.</p>
<h1>Episode17: The Pythons - Somewhere in Tunisia, Circa A.D. 1979</h1>
<p>50 minute documentary, made on location in Tunisia during the shooting of Monty Python's Life of Brian. There are interviews with all of the troupe, excerpts from the TV series and their earlier films, and from some of the solo projects the individuals worked on. Some of the rehearsals for this film are shown. This is actually a fascinating documentary and a superb extra to the film. It gives an insight into the personalities of each of the performers and their relationships with one another.  No Monty Python fan should be without this.  From the Criterion Edition DVD.</p>
<h1>Episode18: The Secret Life of Brian</h1>
<p>A documentary about the making of the controversial Life of Brian and the surrounding accusations of blasphemy</p>
<h1>Episode19: The Life of Python</h1>
<p>The Life of Python was a special run of Monty Python related programs broadcast on BBC2 on October 5, 1999, the 30th Anniversary of the first broadcast of Monty Python's Flying Circus.</p>
<h1>Episode20: Monty Python: Almost The Truth - The BBC Lawyer's Cut</h1>
<p>To commemorate the 'Ruby Jubilee' of Monty Python, this film takes us on a journey telling the story of the Pythons from start to finish. Starting with the very humble beginnings of how the legendary British comedy troupe emerged, we learn how the cast met, their early influences and how they went on to create ground-breaking television, and their transition into movies that would change the face of comedy forever. Featuring brand new interviews with John Cleese, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam, Michael Palin, and Eric Idle as well as archive interviews from Graham Chapman, this film explores the highs and the lows, and examines how Monty Python became a British institution. This is the first time the Pythons have come together for a film project since 1983's Monty Python's The Meaning of Life.</p>
<h1>Episode21: Olympic sketch (German)</h1>

<p>The sketch so controversial that it had to be dropped by the BBC before it could be seen again.</p>
<h1>Episode26: Dentist on the Job (Meaning of Life Intro)</h1>
<h1>Episode27: How to Irritate People</h1>
<p>In this mock-documentary, John Cleese narrates a series of sketches on irritation -- types and techniques. Included are parents irritating their children, old ladies irritating movie-goers in a theater, an overly subservient waiter, a car repairman denying obvious car trouble, a party guest hinting for a ride, airplane pilots playing practical jokes on their passengers, and a talk show host who doesn't stop talking. </p>
<h1>Episode28: The Secret Policeman's Ball</h1>
<h1>Episode29: Omnibus - Life of Python</h1>
<p>Omnibus episode "Life of Python", broadcast 1990-10-05. Different cut from the VHS/LD release, the latter doesn't have the narration by John Lloyd or the shots from the Memorial Service.Nothing whatsoever to do with the A&E DVD of the same name - that one contains the 1999 documentaries about Monty Python!</p>
<h1>Episode30: Holy Flying Circus</h1>
<p>In 1979, Monty Python made Life of Brian and the debate about what is an acceptable subject for comedy was blown wide open. This is a fantastical re-imagining of the build-up to the release of the film and the controversy it caused.</p>
<h1>Episode31: Friday Night, Saturday Morning</h1>
<p>Friday Night, Saturday Morning was a live chatshow, that was one day in 1979 the site of one of a strange debate between on the one hand John Cleese and Michael Palin, representing Monty Python, and on the other hand malcolm muggeridge and the bishop of Southwark. The subject was wether or not "Life of Brian" was a blasphemous movie or not.As one of the Pythons commented later, it was a very strange scene, quite a Python sketch in itself, except that the Pythons discussed the matter seriously while their opponents were quite ludicrous in their statements. Also, it is one of the few occasions where Michael Palin gets angry.</p>

<h1>Episode51: Monty Python Live (Mostly)</h1>
<p>Knotted hankies at the ready: it's Monty Python's historic last stand broadcast live from London's O2 Arena. It's been more than three decades since they last appeared on stage together for a Hollywood Bowl show. But now surviving Pythons John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin - combined age: 357! - are dusting down those classic comedy routines for their final farewell. There was a phenomenal demand for tickets when this run of ten reunion shows at the O2 Arena was announced. The legendary quintet promise a selection of their finest sketches with modern, topical and suitably Python-esque twists. It's certain to be one of the greatest live events of the year, as well as an emotional experience for the Pythons and their fans. Expect laughter and tears. But mostly laughter.</p>
<h1>Episode52: 30 Years of Monty Python, a Revelation</h1>
<p>Monty Python's 30th birthday was celebrated by the (UK) Paramount Comedy Channel with this program which showed a few of the deleted scenes from Life of Brian - unrelated to "Python Night" on the BBC that same year. Jonathan Ross interviews the (living) members of Monty Python. Ross tells a fake story about how they found the deleted scenes but the truth is, they had been released on the criterion LaserDisc 2 years earlier in 1997. (Although the 'rushes' of the film really were destroyed around this time when the Handmade Films company was sold!) </p>
<h1>Episode53: Monty Python: The Meaning Of Live</h1>

<h1>Episode60: And Now for Something Rather Similar</h1>
<h1>Episode61: Looks Like a Brown Trouser Job - Monty Python's Graham Chapman College Tour</h1>
<p>In the early 1980s, Monty Python's Graham Chapman embarked upon a second career as a public speaker. Throughout the decade he toured hundreds of North American colleges delivering "comedy lectures" which consisted of tales from his life, adventures with an ad hoc group of adrenaline junkies called the Dangerous Sports Club, equally dangerous friends like the Who's Keith Moon and, of course, his fellow Pythons. In the spring of 1988 he launched his final college tour before his death in 1989, the best of which is presented here, videotaped under Graham's supervision and taken from his personal archives. It's a historical and hysterical - document, capturing Graham at the peak of his comedic powers, at ease and at home before a crowd of Chapmaniacs.</p>
<h1>Episode62: In The Beginning (The Roots of Python)</h1>
<p>An in-depth look at Britain's most triumphantly hilarious comedy troupe, this documentary covers Monty Python's early work -- including their legendary comedy sketch show -- as well as their later television series and films.
