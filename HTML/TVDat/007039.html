<p>Goku powers up to his maximum level - which is far greater than that of even Captain Ginyu! Yet, for some strange reason, Goku's current enemy doesn't seem too worried. After the Eldest Namek gives Dende a mysterious new power and sends him off to meet the Earthlings, Nail begins battling Frieza. While Frieza is clearly the stronger of the two, he is surprised at Nail's ability to regenerate lost limbs.

<p>After killing Jeice, Vegeta sets his sights on Ginyu (still in Goku's body.) Vegeta effortlessly pummels Ginyu, and an attempt by Ginyu to get Vegeta's body is thwarted by Goku who intervenes - ending up back in his own (wounded) body, and Ginyu going back to the body he had before - which he had deliberately wounded. Vegeta begins thrashing Ginyu in his native body, and once again quick thinking on Goku's part prevents Vegeta from being swapped with Ginyu's body - Goku throws a Namekian frog in the path of the beam, trapping Ginyu in the frog's body. Vegeta places Goku in a rejuvenation chamber inside Frieza's spaceship and gives armor to Krillin and Gohan - knowing an inevitable battle against Frieza is in their future. Vegeta begins sleeping to regain strength he lost while fighting Ginyu. Meanwhile, Nail continues to fight Frieza and does no damage to the tyrant. Once beaten and fallen, Nail reveals the truth - the fight was just a diversion to get the password to use the Dragon Balls to the Earthlings! Frieza begins charging back towards his spaceship, noticing his scouter no longer shows the power levels for the Ginyu Force. Krillin, Gohan, and Dende take the Dragon Balls, and Dende uses the password to summmon Porunga, the Namekian Dragon Balls' equivalent of Shenron.</p>
<h1>Episode36: Der wütende Freezer rückt näher! Polunga…erfülle unseren Wunsch!</h1>
<p>Porunga, the Namekian Eternal Dragon, is summoned. However Krillin, Gohan and Dende are met with some bad news when they discover that only one dead friend can be resurrected per wish! Piccolo communicates with the Earthlings, telling them to revive him and wish him to the Planet Namek. Dende speaks the first wish and Piccolo's halo disappears - and Kami is resurrected on Earth, much to Mr. Popo's joy. The second wish is made, however, Piccolo is nowhere in sight. Dende tells them that they wished him to the Planet Namek and not their specific location, however - so the third wish can be used to transport him to that particular spot. Unfortunately, things take a turn for the worst. Vegeta is awakened by sensing the approaching Frieza's power, and quickly awakens and rushes to where the Earthlings are making their wishes. He threatens them for stealing his chance at immortality, though they accidentally reveal that there is one more wish left - which he would be able to use to get immortality. He tells Dende to make him immortal, and with Frieza fast approaching, Krillin reluctantly tells Dende to wish Vegeta immortal - stating that, if nothing else, he is at least better than Frieza. Before he can deliver the wish, however, the Eldest Namek dies, causing the Dragon Balls to stop working. Vegeta is outraged at the Earthlings since his chance for immortality has one again been foiled. His anger at the Earthlings doesn't last, however, since Frieza arrives at the battlefield at that very moment. The tyrant begins charging up, terrifying everyone but Vegeta who seems strangely calm. The entire planet begins to shake violently as Frieza summons his power - as Goku remains in the rejuvenation chamber, slowly still recovering from the injuries his body had taken during the earlier Ginyu conflict.</p>

<p>Piccolo arrives on Planet Namek following being resurrected and wished there. He begins rushing towards the battlefield, and along the way encounters an ailing Nail, on the brink of death. Piccolo reluctantly performs Namekian fusion with Nail, which increases his power substantially, and begins rushing back to the battlefield. Meanwhile, Frieza, after battling the Earthlings and Vegeta in his first form, transforms to his second form following some goading from Vegeta - and this increases the tyrant's power level to over a million! With his increased power, Frieza charges at Krillin in the air, impaling him on his horn.</p>
<h1>Episode38: Der fürchterliche Freezer! Son Gohans außergewöhnliche Kraft</h1>
<p>With Goku still healing from the previous battle and Piccolo still on the way to their location, Gohan takes it upon himself to hold up against the might that is Freeza's transformed self.</p>
<h1>Episode39: Der wiedererweckte Piccolo ist da! Die zweite Verwandlung des wütenden Freezers</h1>
<p>While Goku continues to recover in the rejuvenation chamber at Frieza's ship, Piccolo begins battling Frieza himself - and surprisingly manages to hold his own! The two exchange blows pretty evenly for a good portion of the fight. Piccolo realizes Frieza slightly holds the upper hand, so he removes his weighted clothing and begins winning against the tyrant. Frieza finds himself backed into a corner, so he decides it is best to transform again to fight Piccolo. Becoming his grotesque, ugly third form, Frieza once again gains the upper hand and begins obliterating Piccolo with a rapid finger beam blast. Gohan rushes to rescue his mentor, and when Krillin tries to follow suit, Vegeta stops him - revealing to Krillin he may have a strategy that will allow him to defeat the tyrant. </p>

<p>Frieza dodges Gohan's attack but quickly finds himself on the receiving end once again - the young half Saiyan unleashes a massive energy blast that even the tyrant himself has difficulty deflecting! Upon seeing what he is up against in the form of these warriors who seem to be getting progressively stronger, Frieza begins transforming to his fourth form - the final and most powerful. Vegeta's plan to defeat Frieza involves having himself mortally wounded and then being healed by Dende - which the Saiyan prince achieves by having Krillin shoot an energy blast through his chest. Dende has no interest in healing Vegeta (who harmed so many of his people), however, and flies over to heal Piccolo instead. However, Nail's essence within Piccolo tells him that healing Vegeta may be the only way to win the fight - so Dende reluctantly does so. Frieza eventually reaches his final form, and immediately kills Dende with an energy blast - having witnessed his healing abilities while transforming. Krillin, Gohan, and Piccolo go on the attack but the tyrant dodges every single attack they throw his way. Vegeta watches them fight from a hill, preparing to charge up to his newfound power level as Gohan finds himself on a direct collision course with another one of Frieza's blasts.</p>

<p>Able to follow Freeza's movements closer than before, Vegeta believes to have reached the legendary Super Saiyan state.

Goku lets loose with a massive Kamehameha that even Frieza himself has difficulty deflecting! Unfortunately, it isn't enough and Goku quickly finds himself of the receiving end again. Once again, he begins seeing a vision, this time of Vegeta and other Saiyans of the past, including his father Bardock. Motivated once again, he lunges at Frieza, powered up.</p>

The battle then begins, and it's clear that Vegeta has the edge over Android #19. Even the android's energy absorption attack proves futile, as Vegeta tears off the android's arms, making the technique impossible to use.

<h1>Episode70: Ein hinterhältiger Trick, die Sonnenattacke - Der Cyborg Cell greift an</h1>
<p>Cell explains that he was born by the computer used by Doctor Gero. A long time ago Doctor Gero began collecting the cells of the greatest warriors to research how he could synthesize an android from these cells. However, because it was taking too much time, he gave up on it partway through but the computer continued its operation. Piccolo, Goku and Vegata's cells were collected at the battle when Vegeta first came to Earth. They also obtained Freeza and his father's cells when they came to Earth which explains all the different ki readings. A small spy robot, similar to Cell, was used to collect the cells while also collecting data and sending it to the computer but Piccolo destroyed it during the fight. Even though Doctor Gero's laboratory was destroyed, there was still a small room beneath the laboratory where the computer is. Cell furthermore explains how once he has turned back into an egg he requires three years underground to mature again and that he came back from the future because the absorption of human essence is not enough to achieve his perfect form; it is necessary for him to merge with two essential specialized life forms which the computer told Cell that they were the androids that Doctor Gero has created #17 and #18! In the future #17 and #18 weren't around but luckily Trunks had his time machine so he killed Trunks and came back to his era in search of #17 and #18. The reason why Cell chose this era was because Trunks's time machine already set for this era to warn the other about the androids so all Cell did was push the switch. The computer also told Cell that once he reaches his perfect form, he will have terrible power far greater than anymore imagined. After obtaining all of the information, Piccolo pulled off his shriveled arm and grew a new one. Just when Piccolo and Cell were about to fight Trunks and Krillin arrive. Realizing he has no chance of winning, Cell retreats by blinding them with Taiyoken and escapes to absorb more humans in the direction of Nickytown. Vegeta arrives at the scene and sees that the massive ki reading was Piccolo and when Tien finally arrives Piccolo explains to everyone what he has learnt from Cell.

He then tells Gohan to deliver the finishing blow to Cell, but Gohan insists that Cell must suffer first. Cell then utilises his bulked-up transformation, but the increase in muscle mass lowers his speed greatly and as a result none of his attacks connect with Gohan - who counters with a single blow to the stomach, causing Cell to regurgitate Android 18 and revert back to his semi-perfect form.

<h1>Episode01: 7 Jahre danach! Ab heute ist Gohan Highschool-Schüler</h1>
<p>Seven years have passed since the battle with Cell. Gohan is now a high school student attending Orange Star High School in Satan City. On his way to his first day of school, he comes across a bank robbery in the city and stops it with his Super Saiyan form. As rumors spread about a "Golden-Haired Warrior", Gohan gets to know his new classmate and Satan's daughter, Videl. After a day of trying not to act suspicious in front of his classmates, Gohan approaches Bulma, who gives him a transformation watch to hide his identity. </p>
<h1>Episode02: Aufgedeckt! Der neue Held ist Son Gohan</h1>
<p>As Videl is called in to stop a bus hijacking, Gohan, using the alias "Great Saiyaman", pitches in to help the passengers while Videl handles the criminals. The next day, Gohan learns that Chobi, the child of Toto the pterodactyl, has been captured by a circus and put on display. In his attempt to rescue Chobi, Gohan is portrayed as a criminal and is pursued by Videl. However, when Chobi's parents attack the city in search of their child, Gohan manages to handle the situation and return Chobi to his parents. Later, Videl, who discovers the truth that Gohan is Great Saiyaman, blackmails him into participating in the 25th World Martial Arts Tournament. As some of the other Z Fighters express interest in the tournament, Goku calls out from the Other World, saying he will return to Earth for a single day to particpate. </p>
<h1>Episode03: Gohan ist der Lehrer! Videls Flugeinführung</h1>
<p>After Gohan spreads word of the tournament to the others, as well as managing to convince Chi-Chi to let him participate himself, Gohan takes a leave of absence from school and begins training with Goten. Gohan is surprised to find that Goten not only possesses great strength, but is also already capable of transforming into a Super Saiyan, although he has yet to learn how to fly. Later, Videl comes around to have Gohan make good on his promise to teach her how to fly using bukū-jutsu, with Gohan starting her off with the basics of learning how to control her energy. Within a day, Videl has managed to learn how to float while Goten has managed to learn how to fly. Following a remark from Gohan, Videl comes back the next day with her hair cut, determined to learn more from Gohan. Meanwhile, Vegeta is also surprised to find that Trunks is also capable of becoming a Super Saiyan, whose strength is slightly higher than Goten's, while Goku trains fiercely in anticipation for the tournament. </p>
<h1>Episode04: Das Dragon-Team komplett versammelt! Son Goku ist zurückgekehrt!!</h1>
<p>After ten days of training, Videl manages to master flight, finally giving Gohan and Goten the opportunity to resume their training for the tournament. On the day of the tournament, Gohan suggests to Vegeta, Goten, and Trunks that they don't use their Super Saiyan forms during the tournament to avoid hassle from the press. Arriving at the island where the tournament will take place, Gohan and the others are greeted by Goku, who the fortune teller Baba has granted 24 hours to stay on Earth, allowing him to meet Goten for the first time, while Piccolo destroys all the cameras in the area to keep Gohan's identity a secret. After the participating fighters register for the tournament, with Goten and Trunks forced to participate in the junior division, the preliminary rounds begin, where the fighters must hit a punching machine to rank their strength, with the Dragon Team effortlessly qualifying. </p>
<h1>Episode05: Alle sind schockiert! Gotens und Trunks' Super-Battle!!</h1>
<p>While Gohan and Videl wait to take their preliminaries, Goku, Vegeta, and the others go to spectate the junior division, where Goten and Trunks effortlessly progress through each round until they face each other in the final round. The battle gets more and more intense, with Goten and Trunks surprising the audience with advanced techniques and even turning Super Saiyan. The match eventually comes to an end where a sneak attack by Trunks causing Goten to lose by ring-out. Satan, who had spectated the fight and had been reminded of the battle with Cell, now faces a pinch as he now has to fight against Trunks. </p>
<h1>Episode06: Eine beunruhigende Vorahnung... Ein mysteriöser Krieger taucht auf!!</h1>
<p>After various attempts to try and get out of the fight, Satan decides to pretend to lose and have Trunks hold back his attack in order to keep up his appearance, though even Trunks' weakest punch manages to send Satan flying. During an intermission, Trunks and Goten decide to take out one of the participants and steal his clothes in order take his place in the adult division. Meanwhile, as Goku and the others get something to eat, they encounter a pair of mysterious participants, Shin and Kibito, who Piccolo determine as not being from Earth. As the sixteen qualifying participants gather together to decide the drawings for the first round, Gohan is paired up against Kibito while Goku gets paired up against Vegeta. </p>
<h1>Episode07: Was ist los, Piccolo?! Ein unerwarteter Ausgang der ersten Runde</h1>
<p>As the drawings come to a close, Piccolo is put up against Shin while #18 is up against Satan. After Krillin wins his first match against his opponent, Piccolo and Shin face against each other, but as Piccolo senses an overwhelming power coming from Shin, he decides to forfeit the match before it even begins, feeling Shin's power is far beyond his own. As Videl prepares to go up against a man named Spopovitch, Piccolo learns from Kibito that Shin is actually the Supreme Kai, believed to be even more powerful than the Grand Kai. Videl appears to get the upper hand in her match, but Spopovitch keeps getting up no matter how many times he is knocked down and eventually fights back. Goku suspects something amiss about Spopovitch, which proves true when he continues fighting even after Videl breaks his neck. Videl attempts to use her flight to regain her strength, but Spopovitch follows her into the air and uses energy blasts against her. As Videl refuses to give up despite the beating she is taking, Goku wonders where Spopovitch got his power from. </p>
<h1>Episode08: Videl, ganz erschöpft - Gohans Wut ist am Limit!! </h1>
<p>With Spopovich nearly beating Videl to death, Gohan loses his temper and prepares to storm onto the field, but Spopovich's partner, Yamu, convinces Spopovich to end the fight by pushing Videl out of the ring. With Videl heavily injured, Goku uses his instant transmission to receive some senzu beans from Korin, which Gohan gives to Videl to restore her to full health. Gohan, whose identity is revealed to his classmates after his bandana was blown off during his outburst, steps up to face against Kibito, who requests to see Gohan's Super Saiyan transformation. After Piccolo informs the other Z-Fighters of Shin's identity as the Supreme Kai, he orders Gohan to transform. Right after Gohan transforms, Spopovich and Yamu appear and use a device to drain his Super Saiyan energy, leaving him weakened. As Kibito offers to tend to Gohan, the Supreme Kai asks Goku and the others to join him in pursuing the culprits. </p>
<h1>Episode09: Eine schleichende Verschwörung!! Geheimnisse des schrecklichen Majin</h1>
<p>As Goku and the others set off to join the Supreme Kai, Kibito uses his unique ability to restore Gohan's energy, before the two of them, along with Videl, set off after the others. Along the way, Supreme Kai and Kibito explain to the others about how an evil mage named Babidi is seeking to revive an evil being known as Majin Buu, who was responsible for the death of four Supreme Kais long ago. To accomplish this, he manipulated Spopovich and Yamu to join the tournament and steal Super Saiyan energy needed to break the seal placed on Buu. Unable to push her flight any further, Videl, coming to understand that Gohan was the one who defeated Cell back then, places her faith in him and returns to the tournament grounds, while Gohan and Kibito catch up to Goku's group. Arriving at the site of a buried spaceship, the Z-Fighters lay in watch as Spopovich and Yamu deliver Gohan's energy to Babidi and his partner, Dabura, the Demon King. </p>
<h1>Episode10: The Heinous Mage Babidi and King of the Dark Underworld Doubler's Trap</h1>
<p>Supreme Kai and Kibito warn Goku and the others about the malicious pair, with Dabura being the strongest being of the underworld and Babidi possessing magic powerful enough to sway him to become his henchman. Having obtained the energy from them and deeming them of no further use, Babidi kills Spopovich with his magic while having his other henchman, Pui Pui, kill Yamu. Having detected the presence of the Z-Fighters, Babidi and Pui Pui head inside of the ship while Dabura attacks the group, immediately killing Kibito and firing his spit at Krillin and Piccolo, turning them into stone. Learning that they can only unpetrify them by killing Dabura, the remaining fighters chase after him into the ship, despite Supreme Kai's warnings. Upon reaching the first floor, they are confronted by Pui Pui, who informs them they must face several floors before they can reach Babidi at the bottom. The Saiyans, however, don't think much of their opponent and play a game of rock-paper-scissors to decide who should fight him, with Vegeta stepping up against him. </p>
<h1>Episode11: Don't Underestimate a Super Saiyan! Vegeta and Gokuu's Full Throttle Power!</h1>
<p>As Vegeta easily outmatches Pui Pui in terms of fighting skill, Babidi changes the stage to match that of the high gravity planet, Zun, where Pui Pui is at his top fighting form. However, this makes no difference to Vegeta, who obliterates his opponent and opens the way to the next floor. Believing the Saiyans to not be underestimated, Babidi sends in his next warrior, Yakon, and changes the stage to that of Planet Ankoku, but even with the aid of pitch black darkness, Yakon is no match for Goku's keen senses. When Goku turns Super Saiyan, however, Yakon uses his ability to consume light and sucks in Goku's energy, turning him back into normal. Rather than finding an alternative way to fight, Goku instead feeds him even more Saiyan energy until he explodes from being overloaded, allowing Goku and the others to move onto the next stage. </p>
<h1>Episode12: Who is the World's Greatest?! A Battle Royal Deciding Match!!</h1>
<p>As Babidi fears the power of the Saiyans, Dabura decides to face them himself, going inside a meditation chamber to raise his power before his battle. Meanwhile, back at the tournament, Goten and Trunks take a break from their Mighty Mask disguise to get some drinks, barely avoiding having their cover blown. With Goku and the other members still missing, Satan suggests that a battle royale be held between the remaining contestants; #18, "Mighty Mask", Killa, Jewel, and himself. As the match begins, Killa and Jewel are quickly dispatched by #18 and the Trunks/Goten combo, who proceed to ignore Satan and go after each other. </p>

<p>As the battle between #18 and "Mighty Mask" continues to escalate, #18 struggles to keep up with her opponent's unpredictable moves, but manages to land a critical hit against the pair, knocking them into the center of the stage. Goten and Trunks decide to switch places with Goten now on top, pushing #18 to the point where she starts using energy blasts against them, but she manages to hit back with support from her child. The pair decide to go Super Saiyan and launch a powerful blast at #18, but she manages to dodge it and reveal their true identity, resulting in the pair becoming disqualified, leaving #18 and Satan as the only remaining fighters. As Goten and Trunks come across Videl upon her return, Dabura emerges from his meditation chamber, ready to face off against Gohan. </p>

Learning that Vegeta still retains a lot of evil in his heart, Babidi uses his magic to target Vegeta's mind and sway him over to his side. To make matters worse, Babidi transports everyone to the tournament grounds, where Vegeta, still focused on his desire to defeat Goku, prepares to face off against him even with innocent bystanders watching. </p>
<h1>Episode16: I'm the Strongest! The Clash: Goku vs Vegeta</h1>
<p>Vegeta begins his attack on Goku, killing several innocent people in the crowd without any remorse. Realising Vegeta had fallen under Babidi's spell on purpose purely for the sake of his grudge, Goku is left with no choice but to fight against him, despite Supreme Kai's attempt to stop him, and has Babidi warp them to somewhere they can fight alone.

<p>While Goku and Vegeta's fight gets underway, building energy for Majin Buu each time Goku takes damage, Gohan and Supreme Kai arrive at Majin Buu's egg, where they are confronted by Babidi and Dabura. Before the fight between them can begin, Majin Buu's egg reaches full power as a result of Goku and Vegeta's battle. </p>
<h1>Episode18: The Seal Is Broken!? Gohan's Last-Ditch Kame Hame Ha</h1>
<p>Goku and Vegeta's fight continues to escalate, with Vegeta revealing he chose to go under Babidi's control in order to gain the strength to face against Goku, feeling he needed to get rid of his gentle side.

The egg splits apart with seemingly nothing more than pink smoke coming out of it, leading Supreme Kai to presume Majin Buu had been destroyed. However, Gohan senses a powerful energy from the smoke, which forms together to make Majin Buu, who appears to be nothing more than a mere child. </p>

However, Buu soon shows off his frightening strength when he effortlessly beats Dabura, the rise in his power level even catching the attention of the other Saiyans. Although Goku tries to convince Vegeta to postpone the fight in order to stop Buu, Vegeta knocks out Goku when he drops his guard, taking a senzu bean and setting off to fight Buu himself.
