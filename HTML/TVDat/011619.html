<p>Unser blauer Planet zeigt diese unbekannte Welt in einer nie zuvor gesehenen Weise. In acht Folgen erzählt die einzigartige Dokumentation vom Leben an Felsküsten und Korallenriffen, von Mangrovenwäldern und Polarmeeren, von der Tiefsee und vom offenen Meer. Die Kamera begleitet die größten Wale der Meere, zeigt Ballette riesiger Fischschwärme, beobachtet fliegende Pinguine und folgt Eisbären bei der verzweifelten Suche nach Nahrung. Und sie taucht in die ewige Nacht der Tiefsee, wo sich monsterartige Fische in ewiger Dunkelheit verbergen. </p>

<h1>Season01</h1>
<h1>Episode01: Leben im Meer</h1>
<p>Experience the power of the blue whale - the largest mammal ever to grace our planet. Learn how the sun and moon help control and tame the ocean. Travel far and wide - from the Eastern Pacific to Alaska, from the Bering Sea to the shores of Southern California - and begin to understand the complexity and power of our oceans.</p>
<h1>Episode02: In der Tiefsee</h1>
<p>A place of mountain ranges, perpetual night, pressures extremes and cold... and the weirdest life forms on our planet. Dive into the depths of the ocean, an eerie world where predators with teeth so large they can't even close their mouths, chase bio-luminescent creatures of the deep. Discover the spectacular smoking chimneys of the hydrothermal vents. Go deeper down than you have ever been...</p>
<h1>Episode03: Im offenen Meer</h1>
<p>In the immense space of the open ocean the sea bed is a staggering five miles below the surface and the nearest island is over 300 miles away. Yet here live many of the most spectacular predators in the ocean. Marvel as you experience ruthless and beautiful battles between hunter and prey.</p>
<h1>Episode04: Im Eismeer</h1>
<p>An environment where only the toughest survive, the Arctic and Antarctic are unrelenting habitats. Only in spring does life begin again. Plankton blooms and feeds fast hordes of migrating fish, walruses rake the seabed for clams, and minke and humpback whales gorge themselves on gigantic swarms of krill. But it is a brief spring feast - the ice soon returns and pushes life back into the ocean.</p>
<h1>Episode05: Im Wechsel der Jahreszeiten</h1>
<p>As the days grow longer, billions of microscopic plankton bloom under the blazing sun. Here in the temperate seas, three-ton basking sharks graze among forests of giant kelp - the fastest growing plant in the world. The forests harbor thousands of other animals, including sea otters, brilliantly colored anemones, squid, and exquisite leafy dragons. But as the year wears on, storms rage in the icy sea... a desperate challenge for the animals that remain.</p>
<h1>Episode06: Im Korallenmeer</h1>
<p>Bathed in bright sunlight and warm clear water, the coral reef is a rich oasis of life - the rainforest of the sea. Bizarrely adorned harlequin shrimp carry off a starfish several times their size, while haunting songs reverberate around the reef, heralding the arrival of humpback whales. Shimmering schools of brightly colored fish battle for territory in this competitive world where you have to stand out to survive.</p>
<h1>Episode07: Im Bann von Ebbe und Flut</h1>
<p>The sun and moon move billions of tons of water with every turn of the tide. The strongest tides empty entire bays, smash trees on riverbanks, and strand sea creatures on suddenly dry land. Weaker tides control the movements of huge numbers of fish, coaxing stingrays though astounding underwater arches. And as the water recedes, the tide can create unbelievable landscapes - like a sparkling world of salt crystals inhabited only by tiny shrimp and bright pink flamingos.</p>
<h1>Episode08: An der Küste</h1>
<p>From rocky cliffs to gentle dunes, the coasts are always changing. Day in and day out, they are battered by crashing waves. Seabirds come here by the thousands to nest, while baby turtles hatch and race to the sea, pursued by hungry predators. Young sea lion pups are born and play on the sand - until a killer whale attacks, crashing in on the surf. But when breeding season is over, life returns to the sea and the shores are empty once again.</p>
