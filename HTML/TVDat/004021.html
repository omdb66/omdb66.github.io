<p>Die beiden Brüder und Alchemisten Edward und Alphonse Elric haben, als sie noch klein waren, einen verhängnisvollen Fehler begangen: Als ihnen die Durchführung einer streng verbotenen Transmutation misslingt, verliert Edward einen Arm. Seinen Bruder trifft es sogar noch schlimmer. Edward kann ihn nur retten, indem er im Zuge eines äquivalenten Tausches sein eigenes Bein opfert und Alphons Seele an eine Rüstung bindet - dessen Körper aber scheint verloren. Ein viel zu hoher Preis, den die beiden für ihren Leichtsinn zahlen mussten. Deshalb beschließen sie alles zu versuchen, um ihre alten Körper zurückzubekommen. Im Bestreben die besten Forschungsbedingungen auf dem Gebiet der Alchemie zu erlangen, führt sie ihr Weg schließlich zur Armee von Amestris. Die Militärdiktatur des Landes setzt sogenannte Staats-Alchemisten als Elitekämpfer in Kriegen und Konflikten ein. In Friedenszeiten hingegen steht es den "Lakaien der Armee" frei, zu forschen und Zugriff auf umfangreiche Aufzeichnungen über Alchemie, sowie entsprechende finanzielle Mittel zu erhalten. Doch schon bald müssen die beiden Elric-Brüder feststellen, dass ihre eigenen Probleme im Vergleich zu der Bedrohung, die dem Land Amestris droht, geradezu unscheinbar wirken...</p>

Darius then takes Al away to a safer place, and Gluttony stumbles upon Pride and Ed's fight. Upon discovering that Lan Fan and Lin can sense homunculi, Pride consumes Gluttony, both to replenish his lives as well as to gain a sense of smell that can detect Ed and his group.

As the Promised Day begins, Greed goes to Central on his own while Ed's group and Scar's group meet up again to devise a plan.

Envy becomes outraged by Roy's change of heart and rants about why everyone does not kill each other, trying to goad them into doing so by pointing out all of the terrible things they have done to each other. Ed determines that the reason Envy hates humans is because he is jealous of their capacity to continue living on, despite all the abuse they take.

<h1>Episode61: Der, der Gott verschlang</h1>
<p>Everyone closest to the center of Father's nationwide transmutation circle, including Ed's group, survives to discover that Father has used the souls of over fifty million Amestrians to suppress God within a new, youthful body. Father neutralizes everyone's alchemy, but, before he can annihilate them, Hohenheim reveals his countermeasure: he had spent years traveling the country, placing fragments of his own Philosopher's Stone into the earth to use as foundation for returning the Amestrian souls to their bodies. The stone fragments are activated by the eclipse's umbra, and the souls are ripped from Father's body back into their original bodies, which weakens Father to the point of barely being able to suppress God anymore. The eclipse then lifts, blinding Bradley with sunlight and allowing Scar to kill him. Scar activates the nationwide alkahestry circle his brother and fellow Ishbalans had been preparing, which restores everyone else's alchemy at their greatest potential. Facing the full strength of his opponents' attacks in his unstable body, Father retreats aboveground to find more souls and replenish his stone supply. Ed remains behind to fight Pride while everyone else chases Father. Pride tries to steal Ed's body to replace his own unstable one, but Kimblee's soul reappears within him and taunts him while Ed enters his body and destroys it, reverting him to the form of a small fetus-like creature.

Before Father can kill Ed and Izumi, the Briggs soldiers, along with several of Ed's allies, join up to attack Father and use up his stone supply. Father lets down his barrier temporarily to try and absorb Greed's stone, giving Ed, Alex and Izumi the opportunity to damage him to the point of defending himself manually. As Father starts to lose control, he creates a blast which traps Ed's arm whilst his automail arm is destroyed. With Ed in danger, Al convinces May to help him perform a transmutation, trading his soul for the return of Ed's right arm.

<h1>Episode63: Auf der anderen Seite des Tors</h1>
