They describe her as a Raira academy student who wears glasses and has big breasts. Kida instantly knows that it is Sonahara and he freaks out, keeping it all to himself. Mikado, still confused even after he had a chat with Yagiri, goes on the Dollars website and reads some of the posts. The members say that they quit and that the leader should do something and one suggests that the Dollars should be more a friendly group and protect Ikebukuro from the Yellow Scarves which Mikado agrees with. In the city, Sonahara is walking home and the Yellow Scarves spot her and they know that she is the invader from her features.
