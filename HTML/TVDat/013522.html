<h1>Season01</h1>
<h1>Episode01: Josef</h1>
<p>The Roman Empire occupies the land of Judea in a time of turbulent unrest, as a simple craftsman named Joseph faces a personal test of faith in the small town of Nazareth, when his fiancee Mary tells him she is expecting a child, who is the Son of God. Joseph vows to love and protect his son Jesus through many dangers: his birth in Bethlehem, the visit of the Magi, and the flight to Egypt to escape death at the hands of mad King Herod.</p>
<h1>Episode02: Johannes der Täufer</h1>
<p>Some thirty years after Jesus is born, his life intersects with that of John the Baptist, a radical preaching in the desert against Judea’s rulers, including Herod’s son, Herod Antipas. John baptizes Jesus, starting his divine mission, but loses his own life, beheaded in a famous conflict with Herod Antipas’s step-daughter, Salome.</p>
<h1>Episode03: Maria</h1>
<p>Mary, the mother of Jesus, is torn between wanting to protect her son and letting him go to fulfill his sacrificial destiny when the time is right; until Jesus is thirty, only she and Joseph know his mysterious mission. Jesus performs his first public miracle at her request at the Wedding Feast of Cana. But as Jesus’ work becomes public, he puts his life–and that of his family–in increasing danger. When Jesus heals a man on the Sabbath in Capernaum, he enrages the authorities and reaches an important crossroad.</p>
<h1>Episode04: Kajaphas</h1>
<p>Caiaphas, High Priest of Jerusalem and religious leader of the Jewish people, faces an impossible dilemma. Caught between determination to preserve his faith and the repressive might of Rome, Caiaphas must judge how great a provocation Jesus of Nazareth might pose. Jesus' astonishing raising of Lazarus from the dead marks a turning point. Afraid that Jesus could prompt an uprising and possible brutal retaliation from Rome's prefect, Pontius Pilate, Caiaphas decides Jesus must be stopped.</p>
<h1>Episode05: Judas</h1>
<p>His name a synonym for traitor even to this day, Judas is known as the devoted disciple who ultimately betrays Jesus. What prompted one of Jesus' closest friends to turn on him remains one of the Bible's great mysteries, one explored as Jesus and his disciples enter Jerusalem for Passover and what will become the Last Supper.</p>
<h1>Episode06: Pontius Pilatus</h1>
<p>Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea, has to make a decision about a troublesome preacher called Jesus. As pressure builds to execute Jesus, Pilate's wife, inspired by a prophetic nightmare, urges him to leave Jesus alone. Instead, Pilate sends him away to be crucified, and publicly washes his hands of responsibility.</p>
<h1>Episode07: Maria Magdalena</h1>
<p>Cured of "seven demons" by Jesus, Mary Magdalene is among his best-known female followers. With his mother, Mary Magdalene witnesses the torment of the crucifixion at the foot of the cross. But her faith is rewarded the most when she is the first to witness the seemingly unbelievable: His resurrection.</p>
<h1>Episode08: Petrus</h1>
