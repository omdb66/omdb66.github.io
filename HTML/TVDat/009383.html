<p>Martin Luther (Maximilian Brückner) and his 95 theses against the indulgence trade triggered a political quake in 1517, thanks also to the book printing. It is true that the Church excommunicated Luther, but the Reformation can no longer be stopped when he does not revoke his theses even before the Emperor. Nevertheless, Luther struggles for the right path, especially with his companion Thomas Müntzer (Jan Lennart Krauter). He also wants to enforce a more equitable world with revolutionary means against the sovereign, while Luther rejects all violence. Ultimately, this dispute leads to the devastating Battle of Frankenhausen, to the death of thousands of peasants and to Thomas Müntzer's execution. </p>

<h1>Season01</h1>
<h1>Episode01: Episode 1</h1>
<p>Five hundred years ago a revolutionary priest changed the face of Christendom and the path of European civilization forever. Risking his life and academic reputation, facing damnation and purgatory in 1517, he pinned his inflammatory 95 Theses to the church door in the Catholic church and the western world would never be the same again. His name was Martin Luther. This is a story of a group of people alive 500 years ago whose internal convictions led them to forge a new path – one that ultimately changed the world.</p>
<h1>Episode02: Episode 2</h1>
<p>1521 – The Catholic church has excommunicated Luther and condemned him as a heretic, but the Reformation can no longer be stopped. Whilst in hiding, and widely believed to be dead, Luther translates the Bible into German for the first time so that the ordinary people can read it.</p>
