<p>Japan im Jahr 2039. Zehn Jahre ist es her, dass der tödliche Apokalypse-Virus, der Menschen in Kristalle verwandelt, das Land heimgesucht hat. Die japanische Regierung konnte die Epidemie nicht selbst eindämmen und bat die Weltgemeinschaft um Hilfe. Eine internationale Organisation namens GHQ besetzte Japan und stellte die Infizierten unter Quarantäne.

Der 17-jährige Schüler Shu Ouma findet sich urplötzlich mitten im Kampf zwischen den Rebellen und der Besatzungsmacht wieder.

Er schließt sich den Undertakern an und kämpft nicht nur für Japan, sondern auch für seine Liebe zur jungen Inori.</p>
