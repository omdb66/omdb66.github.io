One of those former friends, Naruko "Anaru" Anjō, drops by Jinta's house to drop off some homework, but is on bad terms with Jinta. As Meiko pesters Jinta to go to Naruko and talk about her, they both go into the city where they run into two other former friends, Chiriko "Tsuruko" Tsurumi and Atsumu "Yukiatsu" Matsuyuki, the latter of which reacts harshly when Jinta accidentally drops Meiko's name. Frustrated, Jinta runs off and leaves Meiko behind. Jinta recalls that he, Meiko and their other friends were part of a group known as the Super Peace Busters that hang out together. One day, Jinta accidentally hurt Meiko's feelings when asked if he liked her, but Meiko died in a accident before he could apologise to her. Meanwhile, Meiko visits her family's house.
