<h1>Season01</h1>
<h1>Episode01: Der Verräter</h1>
<p>Der Stargate-Veteran Major Gus Bonner muss sich vor einem Kriegsgericht verantworten, da er offenbar ein SG-Team gegen einen ausdrücklichen Befehl in eine Falle geführt hat - was zu Toten und Verletzten geführt hat. Er wird aus dem Stargate-Projekt entlassen. Seine Nichte Stacey Bonner ist zusammen mit R. J. Harrison, Seattle Montoya und dem Ausserirdischen Ec'co als Kadett bei Stargate Command in der Ausbildung und natürlich entsprechend entäuscht von ihrem Verwandten.Kadett Montoya untersucht einen Kokon, den man in einem ägyptischen Sarkophag gefunden hat und in dem man einen Ancient vermutet. Da plötzlich wird ein Verräter im SGC aktiv - ein Formwandler, der in der Gestalt von Gus Bonner das Stargate öffnet und die derzeit ärgsten Feinde der Menschheit durchlässt, die Tlak'kahn. Diese schiessen sich den Weg frei zum Kokon und versuchen mit ihm zu fliehen. Jedoch kommt ihnen die Kadettengruppe mit Unterstützung von Bonner in die Quere und es kommt zu einem heftigen Kampf. Ihnen bleibt nichts anderes übrig, als mitsamt dem Kokon durch das Stargate zu fliehen.Kaum ist das SG-Team verschwunden, ziehen sich auch die Tlak'kahn zurück. Im SGC macht man Gus Bonner für den Angriff verantwortlich und sperrt seine Identifikations-Codes. Somit kann er das irdische Stargate nicht mehr betreten - ebensowenig wie die Kadetten, die ihm gefolgt sind. Der Führer der Tlak'kahn, Da'kyll, schwört Gus Bonner Rache...</p>
<h1>Episode02: Draga</h1>
<p>Gus Bonner führ die Kadetten zu einem mit Wäldern bedeckten Planeten, den er schon von einem früheren Besuch her kennt. Kaum hat man diese Welt betreten, als Harrison schon von einem grossen Raubtier verschlungen wird. Glücklicherweise erweist er sich als schwer verdaulich. Da schlüpft plötzlich das Alien aus dem Kokon und heraus kommt eine Mischung aus Schmetterling und Fledermaus sowie Mensch. Harrison vergleicht den scheinbaren Ancient mit seiner Mathelehrerin, die er immer Drachenlady nannte und so erhält das Wesen den sinnreichen Namen Dra'ca.Die Kadetten lernen nun knuddelige Wesen kennen, die allerdings seit Bonners letztem Besuch krank sind - der Major macht sich dafür verantwortlich und beschliesst, solange zu bleiben, bis er alle wieder geheilt hat. Was ihn daran stört, ist ein Angriff einer Tlak'kahn-Gruppe, die es wieder einmal auf den Ancient abgesehen hat. Diese jedoch offenbart grosse parapsychische Kräfte und kann die Angreifer zurückschlagen. Ebenso gelingt es ihr, die Knuddelwesen zu heilen. Alle sind glücklich und zufrieden.Neben der Enthüllung des Wesens aus dem Kokon - für spätere Gefahrensituationen ist es natürlich sehr praktisch ein Crewmitglied dabei zu haben, das immer mal eine noch nicht bekannte Fähigkeit aus dem Ärmel ziehen kann - spielt die Krankheit der Waldwesen die Hauptrolle. Diverses hatten wir schon in der Serie SG-1, jedoch wäre O'Neill nie auf die Idee gekommen, Stunden damit zu verbringen, kalte Wickel zu verabreichen. Ich weiss nicht, ob mir diese Art von Stargate-Geschichte gefallen kann.... </p>
