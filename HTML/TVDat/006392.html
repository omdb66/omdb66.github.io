<p>Vor mehreren hundert Jahren wurde die Menschheit nahezu von Titanen ausgerottet. Sie sind riesengroß, verfügen über geringe Intelligenz und scheinen Menschen nur des Vergnügens wegen zu fressen. Ein kleiner Prozentsatz an Menschen überlebte, indem sie sich in einer Stadt verschanzten, deren gewaltige Mauern größer sind als selbst die größten Titanen.Die Stadt hat seit über 100 Jahren keinen Titanen mehr gesehen. Der junge Teenager Eren und seine Ziehschwester Mikasa müssen mit ansehen, wie ein "Supertitan" wie aus dem Nichts vor der Stadt erscheint und die Mauern zerstört. Während seine kleineren Artgenossen durch die Löcher in die Stadt einfallen, müssen die Kinder den Horror miterleben, wie ihre Mutter bei lebendigem Leibe gefressen wird. Eren schwört, dass er jeden einzelnen Titanen auf der Welt abschlachten und Rache für die ganze Menschheit nehmen wird.</p>
