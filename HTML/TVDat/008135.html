<p>Takao Kasuga ist literaturinteressiert und liebt besonders die Gedichte von Charles Baudelaire, wie etwa dessen Werk „Les Fleurs du mal“. Ansonsten gehört sein Herz Nanako Saeki und als er eines Tages nach der Schule ihre Turnkleidung findet, stiehlt er diese kurzerhand. Doch bereits am nächsten Tag wird er von seiner Tat eingeholt, denn seine Mitschülerin Sawa Nakamura eröffnet ihm, dass sie ihn dabei beobachtet hat und nur bereit ist, zu schweigen, wenn er einen speziellen „Vertrag“ mit ihr eingeht.</p>
